Parameters

Licensor:             Danil Mikhailov, Dmitrii Stepanov
Licensed Work:        tVault (Trust Vault), tvault-core (Trust Vault Core), Version 0.0.1 or later.
                      The Licensed Work is (c) 2025 Danil Mikhailov, Dmitrii Stepanov.

Additional Use Grant: You may make production use of the Licensed Work, provided
                      your use does not include offering the Licensed Work to third
                      parties on a hosted, embedded, or SaaS basis in a way that
                      competes with Danil Mikhailov, Dmitrii Stepanov paid or hosted versions.

                      A “competitive offering” is a product or service offered to
                      third parties commercially, including through paid support
                      or subscription, that significantly overlaps with the
                      capabilities of any commercial versions of the Licensed Work.
                      Products offered for free and for internal use are not
                      considered competitive offerings.

                      “Product” means software or service that is either installed
                      and used by end users or offered as a hosted or cloud-based service.

                      “Embedded” includes distributing the Licensed Work’s code
                      (modified or not) as part of a larger product or system that
                      offers equivalent or overlapping functionality.

                      Internal use by your organization (including affiliates under
                      common control) is not considered a competitive offering.
